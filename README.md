# ECE635 Project: Home Safety System Using LLM Agents


**Motivation**

We have both taken machine learning courses during our undergraduate studies and enjoyed learning about the field. We would like to take a further step into utilizing the skills we have acquired and further improving them, while also exploring a more specific machine learning application through LLM agents. We believe this specific project will help us expand our understanding and give us the opportunity to be creative in our problem-solving.
